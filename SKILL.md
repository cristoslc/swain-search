# swain-search

Collect, normalize, and cache source materials into reusable troves that swain-design artifacts can reference.

## Script invocation convention

Scripts live under the `scripts/` directory. Use the `<SKILL_DIR>` placeholder to mean the folder holding this SKILL.md. Resolve it at run time. In an installed skill, that is `.claude/skills/swain-search/`. In the standalone repo, it is the project root.

Run the bootstrap once per session before the media or X-thread flows:

```bash
bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/bootstrap.sh"
```

The script checks that `uv` is on `PATH`. After the first run, a marker file at `~/.local/share/swain-search/.bootstrapped` short-circuits later runs. If it exits non-zero, stop and tell the operator what is missing.

## Mode detection

| Signal | Mode |
|--------|------|
| No trove exists for the topic, or user says "research X" / "gather sources" | **Create** — new trove |
| Trove exists and user provides new sources or says "add to" / "extend" | **Extend** — add sources to existing trove |
| Trove exists and user says "refresh" or sources are past TTL | **Refresh** — re-fetch stale sources |
| User asks "what troves do we have" or "find sources about X" | **Discover** — search existing troves by tag |

## Prior art check

Before creating a new trove or running web searches, scan existing troves for relevant content. This avoids duplicating research and surfaces connections to prior work.

### Phase 1 — Literal keyword match

Search for the source name, URL fragments, and author name:

```bash
# Search trove manifests by tag
grep -rl "<keyword>" docs/troves/*/manifest.yaml 2>/dev/null

# Search trove source content
grep -rl "<keyword>" docs/troves/*/sources/**/*.md 2>/dev/null

# Search trove syntheses
grep -rl "<keyword>" docs/troves/*/synthesis.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Phase 2 — Semantic topic match

After fetching the source and understanding what it's about, extract 3-5 topic keywords from the source's *content* (not just its name or URL). Then search existing troves by topic:

```bash
# Search trove tags for topic keywords
grep -l "<topic-keyword-1>\|<topic-keyword-2>\|<topic-keyword-3>" docs/troves/*/manifest.yaml 2>/dev/null

# Search synthesis summaries for topic keywords
grep -l "<topic-keyword-1>\|<topic-keyword-2>\|<topic-keyword-3>" docs/troves/*/synthesis.md 2>/dev/null
```

Topic keywords should describe what the source *is about*, not what it's *called*. For example, a repo named "Cog" that implements a memory system for Claude Code should generate topic keywords like `agent-memory`, `memory-architecture`, `claude-code`, `persistent-memory` — not `cog` or `marciopuga`.

If the source has not been fetched yet (URL-only invocation), use whatever topic information is available from the URL or title and defer full topic matching until after the source is fetched.

### Decision gate

Before proceeding to Create or Extend mode, output a visible routing decision:

> **Prior art check:** Phase 1 found [N matches / no matches]. Phase 2 found [N matches / no matches]: [trove-id (tags: x, y), ...].
> **Decision:** Extending [trove-id] / Creating new trove [slug] because [reason].

This makes the trove routing decision auditable. If any trove matches on 2+ topic keywords, default to Extend mode unless the topic is genuinely distinct (adjacent but different subject matter).

### Action on matches

If existing troves contain relevant sources:
1. **Report what was found** — show the trove ID, matching source titles, and relevant excerpts
2. **Suggest extend over create** — if an existing trove covers the same topic, extend it rather than creating a parallel trove
3. **Cross-link** — if the topic is adjacent but distinct, create a new trove but note the related trove in synthesis.md

This step runs in all modes (Create, Extend, Discover) and before any web searches. Existing trove content is always checked first.

## Verbatim snapshot requirement (sources are evidence, not summaries)

**A normalized source file MUST be a faithful, verbatim reproduction of the original document.** It is evidence — raw material for the researcher. Condensing, paraphrasing, extracting "key points", or rewriting the original into an AI-generated summary is strictly forbidden. The only acceptable place for summarization is `synthesis.md` (trove-level or per-source).

Any source file that reads as a summary, digest, or "TLDR" of the original instead of a faithful reproduction is defective and must be regenerated from the raw snapshot. If the original is a long document, the normalized file must still preserve its full content — the research value is in completeness, not brevity.

Violations detected during review: flag the source as `unverified`, do not publish it downstream, and report the warning to the operator with the instruction to re-fetch from the original URL.

## Snapshot evidence gate (SPEC-220)

Before a remote source can be treated as collected evidence, the run must produce a raw snapshot and a metadata ledger entry in `.agents/search-snapshots/metadata.jsonl`.

Required flow for remote sources:
1. Export/download the raw snapshot first:
   - `bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/export-snapshot.sh" --url "<source-url>" --out-dir ".agents/search-snapshots/raw"`
2. Normalize the downloaded file using `writing-skills` or `skill-creator` (never summary-only browser notes). The normalized output MUST preserve the full content of the original — no truncation, no condensation, no AI rewrites.
3. Log metadata:
   - `bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/log-snapshot-metadata.sh" --source-url "<source-url>" --export-mode "<mode>" --raw-path "<raw-path>" --normalized-path "<normalized-path>" --normalization-skill "<writing-skills|skill-creator>"`
4. Verify before publication:
   - `bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-snapshot-evidence.sh" --source-url "<source-url>"`

If verification fails, mark the source unverified, do not publish it downstream, and report the warning to the operator.

## Create mode

Build a new trove from scratch.

### Step 1 — Gather inputs

Ask the user (or infer from context) for:

1. **Trove ID** — a slug for the topic (e.g., `websocket-vs-sse`). Suggest one if the context is clear.
2. **Tags** — keywords for discovery (e.g., `real-time`, `websocket`, `sse`)
3. **Sources** — any combination of:
   - Web search queries ("search for WebSocket vs SSE comparisons")
   - URLs (web pages, forum threads, docs)
   - Video/audio URLs
   - Local file paths
4. **Freshness TTL overrides** — optional, defaults are fine for most troves

If invoked from swain-design (e.g., spike entering Active), the artifact context provides the topic, tags, and sometimes initial sources.

### Step 2 — Collect and normalize

**Mandatory: every source must be a verbatim reproduction of the original document, not a summary.** The normalized source file is evidence — raw material for research. Condensing, paraphrasing, or extracting "key points" from the original is forbidden. Summarization belongs exclusively in `synthesis.md` (trove-level or per-source). See the "Verbatim snapshot requirement" section above for the full policy.

For each source, use the appropriate capability. Read `references/normalization-formats.md` for the exact markdown structure per source type.

**Web search queries:**
1. Use a web search capability to find relevant results
2. Select the top 3-5 most relevant results
3. For each: fetch the page, normalize to markdown per the web page format
4. If no web search capability is available, tell the user and skip

**Web page URLs:**
1. Fetch the page using a browser or page-fetching capability
2. Strip boilerplate (nav, ads, sidebars, cookie banners)
3. Normalize to markdown per the web page format
4. If fetch fails, record the URL in manifest with a `failed: true` flag and move on

**Sites needing authentication (cookie support):**

When a target site requires authentication or subscription access, supply browser-exported cookies:

1. Export cookies from a browser where you are logged in to the target site:
   - Firefox: use the "cookies.txt" extension, or export from DevTools → Storage → Cookies → right-click → "Export All".
   - Chrome: use the "EditThisCookie" extension or DevTools → Application → Cookies → right-click → "Export".
   - Any tool that produces a JSON array of cookie objects with `Host raw`, `Name raw`, `Content raw`, `Path raw`, `Expires raw`, `Send for raw`, and `This domain only raw` fields.

2. Pass the exported JSON file to `export-snapshot.sh`:
   ```bash
   bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/export-snapshot.sh" \
     --url "<source-url>" \
     --out-dir ".agents/search-snapshots/raw" \
     --cookies "path/to/cookies.json"
   ```
   The `--cookies` flag triggers conversion to Netscape format via `convert-cookies.py` and attaches the cookie jar to the curl request. The export mode is recorded as `<mode>-with-cookies`.

3. If no cookies are provided, the fetch proceeds without authentication (same behaviour as before).

4. For the browser-based page-fetching path (MCP browser tools), cookies from the browser's own session are available automatically — no explicit cookies file is needed. This flag is useful for curl-based snapshot export.

**Google Docs / Drive-like documents:**
1. Export raw content first (required):
   - `bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/export-snapshot.sh" --url "<source-url>" --out-dir ".agents/search-snapshots/raw"`
2. Prefer API export modes (`google-doc-export`, `google-slides-export`, `google-drive-download`).
3. If API export fails, use a browser helper fallback only when available.
4. Normalize the exported file with `writing-skills` or `skill-creator`.
5. Log metadata in `.agents/search-snapshots/metadata.jsonl`.
6. Verify with `verify-snapshot-evidence.sh` before including the source in trove outputs.

**Paywall proxy fallback:**

After fetching a web page, check if a paywall proxy is available for the URL's domain:

1. Run `bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve-proxy.sh" <url>`
   - **Exit 1**: no proxy configured — use the direct fetch content as-is
   - **Exit 0**: outputs `PROXY:<name>:<proxy-url>` and `SIGNAL:<text>` lines
2. If exit 0, check the fetched content for each `SIGNAL` text (case-sensitive literal match)
3. If any signal matches (or the article body is under ~200 words):
   - Log: "Paywall detected for `<url>` — trying proxy fallback"
   - Try each `PROXY` URL in order, fetching via the same page-fetching capability used for web pages
   - First proxy that returns substantive content (more than the truncated original) wins
   - Set `proxy-used: <name>` and `notes: "Full article retrieved via <name> proxy"` in the manifest entry
4. If no signals match: use the direct fetch content as-is (no proxy needed)
5. If all proxies fail: keep the original truncated content, set `notes: "Paywalled; proxies exhausted — content from direct fetch only"`

The registry lives at `references/paywall-proxies.yaml`. Add new domains or proxies there — no skill file changes needed.

**Video/audio URLs (YouTube, Instagram, podcasts):**

Follow the tiered chain below. Each tier writes `/tmp/swain_search_media_transcript.txt`. That file is then normalized per the media format in `references/normalization-formats.md`. The output goes to `sources/<source-id>/<source-id>.md`.

1. **Fetch subs and metadata** via a single yt-dlp call:
   ```bash
   bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/yt-dlp.sh" --write-auto-sub --sub-lang en --write-info-json --skip-download --sub-format vtt -o "/tmp/swain_search_media" "<URL>"
   ```
   For Instagram URLs, add `--cookies-from-browser <browser>` (chrome/safari/firefox/brave). For podcast or conference URLs not already on YouTube, resolve the title to a YouTube link first via a web-search capability.

2. **VTT path (preferred)**. If `/tmp/swain_search_media.en.vtt` exists and is non-empty:
   ```bash
   test -s /tmp/swain_search_media.en.vtt && uv run "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/parse_vtt.py"
   ```
   The script writes `[HH:MM:SS] line` segments. Set `transcript-source: vtt` in the source frontmatter.

3. **Caption fallback**. If no VTT, read `/tmp/swain_search_media.info.json` and take the `description` field. Strip `#\w+` tags. Strip leading and trailing whitespace. If the remaining text is over 100 characters, write it to `/tmp/swain_search_media_transcript.txt` (one paragraph per line). Set `transcript-source: caption`. Omit timestamps.

4. **Frame-extraction fallback (needs operator approval)**. If the caption is too short (100 chars or fewer), stop and ask:
   > No subtitles or usable caption found. I can extract frames and read on-screen text to build a transcript. This needs `opencv-python-headless` (~30MB, via uv). Proceed?

   On approval:
   - Download the video: `bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/yt-dlp.sh" -o "/tmp/swain_search_video.mp4" "<URL>"`. Add `--cookies-from-browser <browser>` for Instagram.
   - Extract frames: `uv run --with opencv-python-headless python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/extract_frames.py" /tmp/swain_search_video.mp4`. Saves `/tmp/swain_search_frame_000.png` and up, via scene-change detection.
   - **Probe vision**. Use the Read tool on `/tmp/swain_search_frame_000.png`. Try to read the visible text. If that works, go to step 5. If not, go to step 6.

5. **Vision OCR (preferred)**. Use the Read tool on each remaining frame. Extract all visible text. Dedupe adjacent-frame repeats. Write the text to `/tmp/swain_search_media_transcript.txt`. Set `transcript-source: vision-ocr`. No timestamps.

6. **Local OCR fallback**. If vision fails, ask:
   > Vision not available. Falling back to local OCR via EasyOCR (~400MB first-run download). Proceed?

   On approval:
   ```bash
   uv run --with "easyocr,opencv-python-headless" python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/ocr_frames.py"
   ```
   Set `transcript-source: local-ocr`. No timestamps.

7. **Normalize and write the source**. Derive the source ID slug from the video title. Use lowercase, numbers, and hyphens only. Write `sources/<source-id>/<source-id>.md` per the media format. Add `transcript-source` to the frontmatter. Add `duration`, `speakers`, and YouTube deep-links only when step 2 ran.

If no tier succeeds, record the source in the manifest with `failed: true` and `reason: <tier>`.

**X/Twitter threads:**

URL pattern: `(x|twitter|fxtwitter|fixupx).com/.+/status/\d+`. Unrolled via the public fxtwitter API. No auth needed.

1. Fetch the thread:
   ```bash
   uv run "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/fetch_x_thread.py" "<URL>"
   ```
   The script writes two files: `/tmp/swain_search_thread.json` holds the raw response, and `/tmp/swain_search_thread_transcript.txt` holds the stitched transcript with cited-post blockquotes. It also prints a metadata JSON object to stdout. Capture these fields: `author_name`, `author_handle`, `author_url`, `published_date`, `tweet_count`, `title_guess`, `source_url`, `post_urls`, `cited_posts`.

2. **Unrollable thread**. If the script exits with "only 1 post returned" on a thread-opener, the upstream deployment lacks an account proxy. Record the entry with `failed: true` and `reason: x-thread-unrollable`. Move on.

3. Derive the source ID as `<author_handle>-<first-few-title-words>`. Sanitize to lowercase, numbers, and hyphens only. Strip any `@`.

4. Normalize per the x-thread format in `references/normalization-formats.md`:
   - Frontmatter: add `author-handle`, `author-name`, `published-date`, and `tweet-count` to the common fields.
   - Body: render every post verbatim as a numbered list. Hyperlink each number back to its tweet URL. Strip leading auto-mention chains. These are the `@handle` prefixes X adds to replies. Hyperlink inline `@mentions` as `[@handle](https://x.com/handle)`. Hyperlink hashtags as `[#tag](https://x.com/hashtag/tag)`.
   - Cited posts: render each `cited_posts` entry as an indented blockquote under the citing post. Append up to 3 substantive self-replies as continuation. Skip bare-URL self-replies; they already appear in `external_links`. Link out if more than 3 self-replies exist.

5. Save to `sources/<source-id>/<source-id>.md`.

**Local files:**
1. Use a document conversion capability (PDF, DOCX, etc.) or read directly if already markdown
2. Normalize per the document format using `writing-skills` or `skill-creator`
3. For markdown files: add frontmatter only, preserve content

**Forum threads / discussions:**
1. Fetch and normalize per the forum format (chronological, author-attributed)
2. Flatten nested threads to chronological order with reply-to context

**Repositories:**
1. Clone or read the repository contents
2. Mirror the original directory tree under `sources/<source-id>/`
3. Default: mirror the full tree. For large repositories (thousands of files), ingest selectively and set `selective: true` in the manifest entry
4. Populate the `highlights` array with paths to the most important files (relative to the source-id directory)

**Documentation sites:**
1. Crawl or fetch the documentation site
2. Mirror the section hierarchy under `sources/<source-id>/`
3. Default: mirror the full site. For large sites, ingest selectively and set `selective: true`
4. Populate the `highlights` array with paths to the most important pages
5. Preserve internal link structure where possible

**CLI tools:**

First, detect if the target is a CLI tool. Check these criteria:
- The target exists in `PATH` (run `command -v <tool-name>`)
- The name matches CLI patterns (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)
- The context indicates a command-line tool

If the target is a CLI tool, run the capture sequence:

1. **Manpage capture:**
   - Run `man <tool-name>`
   - If successful, save as `cli-manpage` type
   - If no manpage, skip to help capture

2. **Primary help capture:**
   - Run `<tool-name> --help`
   - If that fails, try `<tool-name> -h`
   - Save as `cli-help` type

3. **Subcommand discovery:**
   - Look for these patterns in help output:
     - "Commands:" or "Subcommands:" headings
     - Indented command lists under "Usage:" sections
     - Command patterns like `<tool> <command> [options]`
   - Filter out non-commands:
     - Keep single words or hyphenated strings
     - Keep positional arguments from usage lines
     - Skip anything starting with `-` (those are flags)

4. **Recursive subcommand capture:**
   - For each subcommand, run `<tool-name> <subcommand> --help`
   - Save as `cli-subcommand-help` with `depth: 1`
   - If subcommand has its own subcommands, go one level deeper
   - Maximum depth: 2 levels

5. **Failure handling:**
   - No manpage? Use help capture only
   - Both `--help` and `-h` fail? Note in manifest
   - All captures fail? Mark as `failed: true` and continue

Each capture becomes a separate source:
- `sources/<tool>-manpage/<tool>-manpage.md` (type: `cli-manpage`)
- `sources/<tool>-help/<tool>-help.md` (type: `cli-help`)
- `sources/<tool>-<subcommand>-help/<tool>-<subcommand>-help.md` (type: `cli-subcommand-help`)

Each normalized source gets a **slug-based source ID** and lives in a directory-per-source layout:
- **Flat sources** (web, forum, media, document, local): `sources/<source-id>/<source-id>.md`
- **Hierarchical sources** (repository, documentation-site): `sources/<source-id>/` with the original tree mirrored inside

**Source ID generation:**
- Derive the source ID as a slug from the source title or URL (e.g., `mdn-websocket-api`, `strangeloop-2025-realtime`)
- When a slug collides with an existing source ID: append `__word1-word2` using two random words from `references/wordlist.txt`
- If the wordlist is missing, append `__` followed by 4 hex characters (e.g., `__a3f8`) as a fallback

### Step 3 — Generate manifest

Create `manifest.yaml` following the schema in `references/manifest-schema.md`. Include:
- Trove metadata (id, created date, tags)
- Default freshness TTL per source type
- One entry per source with provenance (URL/path, fetch date, content hash, type)

Compute content hashes as bare hex SHA-256 digests (no prefix) of the normalized markdown content:

```bash
shasum -a 256 sources/mdn-websocket-api/mdn-websocket-api.md | cut -d' ' -f1
```

### Step 4 — Generate synthesis

Create `synthesis.md` — a structured distillation of key findings across all sources.

**Two levels of synthesis are permitted:**

1. **Trove-level synthesis.md (required, authoritative).** The single `synthesis.md` at the trove root looks across ALL sources and produces a thematic distillation. This is the canonical summary of what the trove as a whole says.

2. **Per-source synthesis.md (optional).** Individual sources MAY include their own `synthesis.md` alongside the normalized source file (e.g., `sources/<source-id>/synthesis.md`). These are useful for capturing what a source says through the lens of the original search context — e.g., commentary on why this source was selected, what aspect it illuminates, or how it relates to the trove topic. Per-source synthesis must NEVER replace or truncate the full normalized source content; the verbatim source file remains the primary artifact. Per-source synthesis is additive commentary, not a substitute for the original.

Structure the trove-level synthesis by **theme**, not by source. Group related findings together, cite sources by ID, and surface:
- **Key findings** — what the sources collectively say about the topic
- **Points of agreement** — where sources converge
- **Points of disagreement** — where sources conflict or present alternatives
- **Gaps** — what the sources don't cover that might matter

Keep it concise. The synthesis is a starting point, not a comprehensive report — the user or artifact author will refine it.

### Step 5 — Commit and stamp

Use the dual-commit pattern (same as swain-design lifecycle stamps) to give the trove a reachable commit hash.

**Before Commit A** — append a `history` entry to `manifest.yaml` with a `--` placeholder for the commit hash:

```yaml
history:
  - event: created
    date: 2026-03-09
    commit: "--"
    sources: 3
```

**Commit A** — commit the trove content:

```bash
git add docs/troves/<trove-id>/
git commit -m "research(<trove-id>): create trove with N sources

Co-Authored-By: <model-name-from-system-prompt> <noreply@unknown>"
TROVE_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**Commit B** — back-fill the commit hash into the history entry, then update the referencing artifact's frontmatter (if one exists):

```bash
# Replace "--" with the real hash in the history entry
# Update artifact frontmatter: trove: <trove-id>@<TROVE_HASH>
git add docs/troves/<trove-id>/manifest.yaml
git add docs/<artifact-type>/<phase>/<artifact-dir>/   # if artifact exists
git commit -m "docs(<trove-id>): stamp history hash ${TROVE_HASH:0:7}

Co-Authored-By: <model-name-from-system-prompt> <noreply@unknown>"
```

If no referencing artifact exists yet (standalone research), Commit B still stamps the history entry — report the hash so it can be referenced later.

**Push** — after Commit B, ALWAYS push to `origin/trunk` so the trove is immediately available to other agents and sessions. This is mandatory, not optional:

```bash
git push origin trunk
```

**Derive synthesis URL** — construct a stable permalink to the synthesis file for the final report:

```bash
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's/\.git$//' | sed 's/git@github.com:/https:\/\/github.com\//')
SYNTHESIS_URL="${REMOTE_URL}/blob/${TROVE_HASH}/docs/troves/<trove-id>/synthesis.md"
```

### Step 6 — Report

Tell the user what was created:

> **Trove `<trove-id>` created** with N sources — committed as `<TROVE_HASH:0:7>`.
>
> - `docs/troves/<trove-id>/manifest.yaml` — provenance and metadata
> - `docs/troves/<trove-id>/sources/` — N normalized source files
> - `docs/troves/<trove-id>/synthesis.md` — thematic distillation: <SYNTHESIS_URL>
>
> Reference from artifacts with: `trove: <trove-id>@<TROVE_HASH:0:7>`

Always include the synthesis file URL in the report. For multiple troves created in a single run, list each synthesis URL.

## Extend mode

Add new sources to an existing trove.

1. Read the existing `manifest.yaml`
2. Collect and normalize new sources (same as Create step 2)
3. Assign slug-based source IDs to new sources (following the same ID generation rules)
4. Append new entries to `manifest.yaml`
5. Update `refreshed` date
6. Regenerate `synthesis.md` incorporating all sources (old + new)
7. Append a `history` entry with `event: extended` and `commit: "--"` placeholder
8. Commit and stamp (same dual-commit pattern as Create step 5):
   - **Commit A**: `git commit -m "research(<trove-id>): extend with N new sources

Co-Authored-By: <model-name-from-system-prompt> <noreply@unknown>"`
   - Capture `TROVE_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`
   - **Commit B**: back-fill hash in history entry, update referencing artifact frontmatter (if artifact exists)
   - **Push** (mandatory): `git push origin trunk`
   - Derive `SYNTHESIS_URL` (same method as Create step 5)
9. Report what was added, including the new commit hash and the synthesis file URL

## Refresh mode

Re-fetch stale sources and update changed content.

1. Read `manifest.yaml`
2. For each source, check if `fetched` date + `freshness-ttl` has elapsed
3. For stale sources:
   - Re-fetch the raw content
   - Re-normalize to markdown
   - Compute new content hash
   - If hash changed: replace the source file, update manifest entry
   - If hash unchanged: update only `fetched` date
4. Update `refreshed` date in manifest
5. If any content changed, regenerate `synthesis.md`
6. Append a `history` entry with `event: refreshed`, `sources-changed: M`, and `commit: "--"` placeholder
7. Commit and stamp (same dual-commit pattern as Create step 5):
   - **Commit A**: `git commit -m "research(<trove-id>): refresh N sources (M changed)

Co-Authored-By: <model-name-from-system-prompt> <noreply@unknown>"`
   - Capture `TROVE_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`
   - **Commit B**: back-fill hash in history entry, update referencing artifact(s) frontmatter — check `referenced-by` in manifest for all dependents
   - **Push** (mandatory): `git push origin trunk`
   - Derive `SYNTHESIS_URL` (same method as Create step 5)
8. Report: "Refreshed N sources. M had changed content, K were unchanged. New hash: `<TROVE_HASH:0:7>`. Synthesis: <SYNTHESIS_URL>"

For sources with `freshness-ttl: never`, skip them during refresh.

## Discover mode

Help the user find existing troves relevant to their topic.

1. Scan `docs/troves/*/manifest.yaml` for all troves
2. Match against the user's query by:
   - **Tag match** — trove tags contain query keywords
   - **Title match** — trove ID slug contains query keywords
3. For each match, show: trove ID, tags, source count, last refreshed date, referenced-by list
4. If no matches, suggest creating a new trove

## Graceful degradation

The skill references capabilities generically. When a capability isn't available:

| Capability | Fallback |
|-----------|----------|
| Web search | Skip search-based sources. Tell user: "No web search capability available — provide URLs directly or add a search MCP." |
| Browser / page fetcher | Try basic URL fetch. If that fails: "Can't fetch this URL — paste the content or provide a local file." |
| Snapshot export for remote docs | If export fails and no helper exists: mark source unverified, do not publish downstream, report exact URL and failure mode. |
| Media transcription | "No transcription capability available — provide a pre-made transcript file, or add a media conversion tool." |
| Document conversion | "Can't convert this file type — provide a markdown version, or add a document conversion tool." |
| Paywall proxy | Keep truncated content. Note in manifest: "Paywalled; proxies exhausted." Suggest user provide content manually. |

Never fail the entire run because one capability is missing. Collect what you can, skip what you can't, and report clearly.

## Capability detection

Before collecting sources, check what's available. Look for tools matching these patterns — the exact tool names vary by installation:

- **Web search**: tools with "search" in the name (e.g., `brave_web_search`, `bing-search-to-markdown`)
- **Page fetching**: tools with "fetch", "webpage", "browser" in the name (e.g., `fetch_content`, `webpage-to-markdown`, `browser_navigate`)
- **Media transcription**: tools with "audio", "video", "youtube" in the name (e.g., `audio-to-markdown`, `youtube-to-markdown`)
- **Document conversion**: tools with "pdf", "docx", "pptx", "xlsx" in the name (e.g., `pdf-to-markdown`, `docx-to-markdown`)
- **CLI tool capture**: built-in bash capabilities (`man`, command execution) — always available on POSIX systems

Report available capabilities at the start of collection so the user knows what will and won't work.

## Linking from artifacts

Artifacts reference troves in frontmatter:

```yaml
trove: websocket-vs-sse@abc1234
```

The format is `<trove-id>@<commit-hash>`. The commit hash pins the trove to a specific version — troves evolve over time as sources are added or refreshed, and the hash ensures reproducibility.

The dual-commit workflow in Create step 5, Extend step 8, and Refresh step 7 handles this automatically — Commit A records the trove content and Commit B stamps the hash into the history entry and referencing artifact's frontmatter. Do not defer this to the operator.
